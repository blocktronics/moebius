    <p>Your document contains control charachters such as a Horizontal Tabulation (#9), Newline (#10), Carriage Return (#13) or Substitute (#26).</p>
    <p>While editors such as Moebius and Pablodraw will display the printable version of the character and exporting to PNG or BIN is safe, 
    saving a document in a textmode format such as ANS, ASC or DIZ might cause unexpected behavior in DOS viewers/editors, other text 
    terminals or converters which are true to ANSI.SYS such as ansilove. These renderers might show unexpected output like shifted characters or 
    unexpected broken or empty lines. If you care about compability and wish your creation to be perceived as created, it would be 
    best to avoid these characters.</p>
